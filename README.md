# ETHS Tools

## Developing
Thanks to Parcel, there's support for automatically reloading the extension whenever you make a change!  
First, run `npm i` to make sure everything's installed.  
Next, run `npm run dev` to make sure the extension updates on any changes.  
Finally, go to add an extension by clicking "Load Unpacked", then choose the "dist" folder in this repository.
